# Scaned-PDF-Data-Extraction
This project provides a Python script to extract structured data from scanned PDF documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and the Google Gemini API. The extracted information is then saved into an Excel spreadsheet. This solution is particularly useful for automating data entry from forms or reports.
